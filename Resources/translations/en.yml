intro:
    h1: Hi. <span class="muted">My name is</span> Philipp Rieber.

        Git, Ubuntu, Amazon Web Services, databases and many more.
    h4: I'm %age% years old and I live in Munich, Germany.

        body: |
            With my first email in 1999 the internet became my second home.
            After some hardware-fiddling and first steps on the Linux console,
            I really became obsessed by web development while studying the
            selfHTML tutorials. After that, I've never stopped learning new
            technologies: HTML, CSS, PHP, JavaScript, Databases, Flash,
            CMS, OOP, Frameworks, Servers, Git, AWS, Scrum, Cloud Services,
            Mobile and many more.

        head: Web development
        body: |
            I'm a full stack web developer – but not a web designer.
            I mainly develop completely customised web applications and focus
            on DevOps tasks. Thus, I'm not limited to a specific area and
            feel equally comfortable on the client as on the server side
            – as well as on the console, during software design stage, in a
            Scrum team or when exploring a customer's precise needs.

        head: Jobs
        body: |
            I'm working as a Senior Software Engineer at
            [Session Digital GmbH](http://www.sessiondigital.de/)/[Inviqa](http://inviqa.com/).
            Before, I evaluated a FinTech startup idea at [WERK1](http://www.werk1muenchen.de/)
            and worked for seven years as a web developer, team lead and deputy
            managing director of an internet agency (Onemedia GmbH). Besides, I advise
            and support some other projects.

skills:
    intro: |
        For development I use a lot of different concepts, techniques, frameworks,
        toolkits and libraries - some more, some less.

about:
    intro: |
        Besides web development, I write and talk about it and like to support
        other developers. Every free minute I try new tools and libraries, read
        documentation, do tutorials, check IT news or watch video trainings.
        I love to constantly learn new things and to improve my skills.

        head: Conferences
        body: |
            I love to attend web development conferences and workshops. For example,
            I attended [Symfony Live](http://live.symfony.com)
            and the [Symfony Day](http://www.symfonyday.com/de) several times,
            as well as some roadshows, presentations or trainings from Adobe, Amazon and
            Microsoft.

        head: User Groups
        body: |
            I am co-organizing the [Symfony User Group Munich](http://www.meetup.com/sfugmunich/)
            and I do not miss any meetup of the [PHP User Group Munich](http://www.meetup.com/phpugmunich/).
            I'm also an occasional [speaker](#talks) at these User Groups.

        head: Contributions
        body: |
            On [GitHub](https://github.com/bicpi), I'm maintaining
            small Open Source libraries and bundles, as well as
            [this homepage](https://github.com/bicpi/homepage).
            From time to time I contribute to other projects, preferably for the
            [Symfony documentation](https://github.com/symfony/symfony-docs).
            I also like to participate in discussions on [GitHub](https://github.com/bicpi),
            [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/users/1182743/philipp-rieber)
            or various [blogs and fora](https://disqus.com/home/user/bicpi).

publications:
    intro: |
        Every now and then I write articles and books about web development or translate from
        English. In everyday work I'm also texting a lot for case studies, references or
        documentation. Occasionally I blog at
        [blog.philipp-rieber.net](http://blog.philipp-rieber.net).
